was born in the southeast coastal area of China, in a small,\n              quite and beautiful town. But I was not a quite kid, in the\n              reverse, I was always the noisy one with tons of questions and\n              expressions. Fortunately, that curiosity has led me to many\n              delightful advantages in my life. Delving into interaction design,\n              is definitely one of them.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              An occasional TED talk, The Sixth Sense, opened the door of a\n              brand new world for me, a field called Human Computer Interaction.\n              I was so amazed and inspired by that innovative connection they\n              created between the physical and digital world. And that impulse\n              soon evolved into my desire to become a professional in this area,\n              pushed me to set foot on the soil of US and pursue the HCI Master\n              degree in University of Michigan.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              And now, my curiosity has brought me to Twitter, to be a part of\n              the inspiring journey of sharing what's happening around the world\n              and serving the public conversation. Currently, I'm a Sr Design\n              Engineer working on Twitter's design systems, aiming to create a\n              unified design language across the company, to deliver a cohesive\n              user experience to all Twitter users and reflect one Twitter\n              brand.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              With the goal of innovating the way human interacts with digital\n              information, I'm eager to be involved with any freelance projects,\n              opportunities & collaborations.

<h4>Introduction</h4>\n          <p>\n            Retina Wallpaper is a marketing website I designed and created to\n            promote our amazing wallpaper mobile Apps when I did my internship\n            with Appwill. Although it is a very young tech startup with only\n            around 20 people, Appwill is a mobile App developer pioneer who saw\n            the bright future of mobile internet market and the team has been\n            devoted to creating products that can make people's daily life\n            easier and better. With the early awareness of people's eager desire\n            to customize their iPhones, giving the fact that all of them look\n            and even sound exactly the same, Appwill designed and launched a\n            series of wallpaper Apps that servers different user groups and most\n            of them were occupying the top rank in App Store. Very soon, Appwill\n            became to be one of the best wallpaper providers and gained millions\n            of users around the world. By the time I was working on this\n            project, we had reached <b>50,000,000</b> total downloads milestone\n            from the Apple App Store. And this promotion site was born with the\n            mission to extend the marketing channels to cover a much wider range\n            of user population and to push that number even further.\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>My Role</h4>\n          <p>\n            <b>My Role:</b> UX Designer, Web Developer, Learner\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I joined{' '}\n            <Article.Link\n              href='https://www.apptao.com/'\n              target='_blank'\n              rel='noreferrer'\n            >\n              Appwill\n            </Article.Link>{' '}\n            as an intern when I was a junior college student in Beijing. Back in\n            2011, I had just found my interest in the field of human-computer\n            interaction, it was very much a fortune meeting this young team who\n            centralized user experience design and offered me the best\n            opportunity to get involved in every single stage of creating a\n            product. Thus, I'd say my primary role during this amazing\n            internship experience was a learner, learning from designers, deves,\n            product managers, and whoever once stopped by my desk, talked to me,\n            inspired me. And with all the help from this group of passionated\n            creative workers, I then played a better and better role in the team\n            as a UX designer and Web developer.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Whiteboard, Adobe Photoshop\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Outcome</h4>\n          <p>\n            In the first 3 months after we launched the Retina Wallpaper\n            website, it introduced more than <b>30,000</b> new users directly\n            from this site, which contributed around <b>20%</b> proportion of\n            the total App downloads in that period of time. It was really a\n            thrilling result that exceeded everyone's expectation. The success\n            of the Retina Wallpaper website not only opened a new window for\n            promoting our wallpaper mobile Apps to desktop users. But also, it\n            proved the concept that a broadly accessible website is a very\n            effective marketing channel to attract new users from all the\n            different platforms because this media is much easier and cheaper to\n            be broadcasted with a quick overview of the product, some exposure\n            of its trending contents prior download and even a place to see and\n            leave feedback. Later on, we even added sections to introduce the\n            team and job openings. We also launched several other promotion\n            sites for the rest of products and all of them received quite well\n            market responses.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n

compliance risk. From daily\n            emails, HR records to private client documents, companys are\n            producing unfathomable amount of data every single day. Not only it\n            costs exorbitant expense to retain all of those data accumulated day\n            by day, it also becomes a black hole when comes to corporate\n            lawsuits. Companys involved in legal cases are required to identify,\n            preserve, collect and export case-related evidence to the court,\n            thus lack of insights into their data usually leads to the extreme\n            risk and cost when going through the litigation process.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            StoredIQ for Legal is an IBM product designed to optimize enterprise\n            e-discovery workflow and legal processes as an indispensable\n            component of the information lifecycle governance offering suite.

So the project\n            I was assigned to during the designcamp was called \"ILG-Next\" -\n            which later turned out to be the code name of the beta release of\n            StoredIQ for Legal.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In that pilot project, two other designers and I were asked to\n            rethink IBM's existing portfolio in the e-discovery market and see\n            how we could consolidate existing isolated clunky products to\n            deliver a single, unified e-discovery experience. After six weeks'\n            questioning, learning, collabrating and thinking, the small design\n            team consists of three new graduates presented a playback to\n            demonstrate the problems we found and some early exploration on the\n            solutions. And that playback won the inital trust and confidence\n            from business unit executives as well as the rest of product team,\n            which also turns this six weeks pilot project into an innovative\n            offering that IBM wants to invest, earn and success.\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>To Understand</h4>\n          <p>\n            Lack of domain knowledge in the world of e-discovery and legal\n            lawsuits in general was the first challenge we encountered.

To\n            answer this question, the design team visited some of our sponsor\n            users who can each represents a specific industry. We met them in\n            person at their working sites, shadowed and observed their day to\n            day business and interviewed all the different roles they interact\n            with. Synthesized all the facts we learned from the users with the\n            domain knowledghe we gain from the subject matter experts in the\n            team, we developed a general user ecosystem model to present the\n            e-discovery teams which usually have many players occupying\n            different roles at different times.\n          </p>\n\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={2}>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_user_ecosystem} alt='User Ecosystem' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_persona_paige} alt='Persona Paige' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_persona_dave} alt='Persona Dave' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_persona_stewart} alt='Persona Stewart' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n\n          <h5>What problems they are facing?</h5>\n          <p>\n            With a better understanding about the goals and tasks our key\n            personas have, we then put together an As-Is journary map to\n            demonstrate how they currently collaborate with each other in\n            different phases of the entire e-disocvery workflow, how they think\n            and feel during those activities and in the meantime to identify\n            what are the pain ponts.\n          </p>\n\n          <Article.Slider type='center'>\n            <img src={image_as_is_1} alt='As Is Scenario 1' />\n            <img src={image_as_is_2} alt='As Is Scenario 2' />\n            <img src={image_as_is_3} alt='As Is Scenario 3' />\n            <img src={image_as_is_4} alt='As Is Scenario 4' />\n            <img src={image_as_is_5} alt='As Is Scenario 5' />\n          </Article.Slider>\n\n          <h5>Where do we stand?</h5>\n          <p>\n            In addition to the user researches I mentioned above, we also spent\n            some time learning and evaluating the exisiting IBM products we had\n            in the market. As you may quickly feel dizzy looking at the\n            screenshots, these \"legacy\" products are not delightful to use for 8\n            hours a day and 5 days a week. Although they do techinically solve a\n            lot problems behind the scene, these products are more led by\n            technology and only doing what we can do instead of being driven by\n            our users and doing what they need. Unitl now, we finally achieved\n            the alignment with executives and product manager about the business\n            goal for this project: to consolidate existing offerings with a\n            human-centered redesign.\n          </p>\n\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={2}>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_before_product_1} alt='IBM Atlas Product' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_before_product_2} alt='IBM DiscoveryIQ Product' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Explore & Prototype</h4>\n          <h5>Fail Fast</h5>\n          <p>\n            \"Fail fast.\" This is a sentence I heard a lot during the designcamp\n            when the educators talking about applying design thinking in a giant\n            company like IBM. It is not only about the philosophy to do\n            busniess, to be more responsive to the market, or to be more agile\n            in development, it also makes perfect sense when designing products,\n            especially designing enterprise level ones. The cost of fixing a\n            problem after the product release can easily be a million dollar\n            difference, compared with fixing it during the very early design\n            period. Thus, paper prototype was the cheap way we constantly took\n            to do our exploration, test concepts and verify assumptions with\n            users.\n          </p>\n\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={2}>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_paper_prototype_1} alt='Paper Prototype' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_paper_prototype_2} alt='User Test' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n\n          <h5>Be More Agile</h5>\n          <p>\n            After validating our ideas on paper with users, we usually started\n            building our Mid-fi wireframes either using Sketch and InVision\n            combination or quickly mocking them up using HTML/CSS/JS if they had\n            more complicated interactions or animations that couldn't be\n            realized in a prototype tool. There were two purposes of creating\n            these Mid-fi wireframes: 1. they were used in our second round\n            testing with a focus more about interaction and usability; 2. they\n            were used as the medium to facilitate internal discussion with\n            Devs/PMs to exchange feedback, estimate rough story size or even get\n            the Dev team started on technical foundation work if the design had\n            been groomed.\n          </p>\n\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={1}>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img\n                src={image_midfi_prototype}\n                alt='Medium Fidelity Prototype'\n              />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n\n          <h5>Push The Pixels</h5>\n          <p>\n            The last but not least stage was of course to deliver the final\n            Hi-fi mockups to the Dev team and push them to bring the design into\n            life pixel perfectly. There was no doubt a lot fightings in the\n            beginning with a traditional IBM Dev team for which it was the very\n            first time to work with real designers in production. But with the\n            continuous education about IBM Design Thinking, along with all the\n            positive voices we heard from our users and stakeholders, the Dev\n            team soon realized the value these new designers brought to the\n            team. As we gradually won their trust, confidence and respect, the\n            collaboration between devs and designers becomes more and more tacit\n            and enjoyable.\n          </p>\n\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={1}>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_product_4} alt='High Fidelity Prototype' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Outcome & Impact</h4>\n          <p>\n            In the 2 years I worked with this super talented and dedicated team,\n            we had successfully delivered 3 solid major releases to the market\n            with the great help we received from our sponsor users.

Just like the\n            App name, it is a community for people to share their beautiful and\n            sweet memories with others, either with friends you are close to or\n            strangers who are willing to listen. Human is a natural social\n            animal and always has social demand. And back to 2011, the explosive\n            growth of smart phone and mobile internet revolutionized the way\n            people used to do social interactions for thousands of years.\n            Sharing has never been that easy with the small device you have in\n            your hand or pocket. Wherever you are, whenever you want, you can\n            take out your smart phone, take a photo or even video, write a\n            couple of words that pop out from your mind, and within 10 seconds,\n            you can share what you are seeing, hearing, feeling or thinking with\n            the rest of the world. It is a new era. And Appwill, as a mobile App\n            developer pioneer, saw the bright future of mobile internet market\n            and since then the team has devoted all the time and effort to\n            create products that can make people's daily life easier and better.\n            Sweet Moments is one of them.\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>My Role</h4>\n          <p>\n            <b>My Role:</b> UX Designer, iOS Developer Intern, Learner\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I joined{' '}\n            <Article.Link\n              href='https://www.apptao.com/'\n              rel='noreferrer'\n              target='_blank'\n            >\n              Appwill\n            </Article.Link>{' '}\n            as an intern when I was a junior college student in Beijing. Back in\n            2011, I had just found my interest in the field of human-computer\n            interaction, it was very much a fortune meeting this young team who\n            centralized user experience design and offered me the best\n            opportunity to get involved in every single stage of creating a\n            product. Thus, I'd say my primary role during this amazing\n            internship experience was a learner, learning from designers, deves,\n            product managers, and whoever once stopped by my desk, talked to me,\n            inspired me. And with all the help from my friendly co-workers, I\n            was then able to get my foot in the door of user experience design\n            as well as iOS development.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Whiteboard, Adobe Photoshop,\n            Adobe Illustrator\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Tech Stack:</b> Objective-C, Cocoa framework\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Outcome</h4>\n          <p>\n            Sweet Moments rocketed up to the <b>Top 100</b> Apps in the Social\n            networking category in the Chinese App Store very soon after it's\n            first launch. After hit the 3 months milestone, we've reached a user\n            population of <b>50,000</b> with an extremely high <b>90%</b>{' '}\n            retention rate. And around <b>70%</b> of the them turned into daily\n            active users and started to generate more and more contents. One of\n            our adorable engineers even created a really cool live-time data\n            visualization to demonstrate the community activation, so every time\n            a new memory was posted we can see a little memory bubble popping up\n            in the monitor. It was such an exciting and inspiring moment when we\n            saw so many memory bubbles floating around everyday.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As you may know, the cold start is usually the most challenging\n            stage for any new social network service, and the key of the way\n            Appwill overcame this difficulty was a smart user diversion mode\n            that introduced a group of elite users from the existing user group\n            of our other Apps. And that first bunch of elite users contributed\n            the majority of the high quality contents to the community which\n            then brought in a lot more new users who were attracted by the\n            interesting contents and the vigorous atmosphere. We also worked\n            closely with that group of elite users to gain direct feedback about\n            our product and selectively took that input into the rapid product\n            iterations. With this healthy and sustaining user feedback loop, we\n            were able to respond to our users and market in a very agile pace.\n            Although we hadn't really figured out the future business model to\n            bring in revenues, we started something small but solid that people\n            love and enjoy using everyday. It's a fascinating experience for me\n            to witness and contribute to the birth of Sweet Moments.\n          </p>\n          <br />\n          <Article.Slider type='mobile'>\n            <img

All these three areas are where the\n            Feather team spend most of our time and effort working on. With\n            these features Feather provides, cross functional product teams can\n            collaborate efficiently to make high-quality Twitter products that\n            feel like one family.\n          </p>\n          <h5>Managed Design Assets</h5>\n          <p>\n            Feather provides managed design assets through a shared Figma\n            library, which contains core styles for all design tokens, like\n            colors and typography, reusable Figma components built with variants\n            and auto-layout which also match our code implementation, common\n            design patterns and guidelines, page templates with different layout\n            serving as boilerplate, and more. Feather’s Figma library helps\n            designers create mockups and prototypes efficiently.\n          </p>\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={isMediumUp ? 3 : 2}>\n            <Article.Multimedia caption='Library structure' withShadow>\n              <img src={image_figma_1} alt='Library structure' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia caption='Get started' withShadow>\n              <img src={image_figma_2} alt='Get started' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia caption='Design tokens' withShadow>\n              <img src={image_figma_3} alt='Design tokens' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia caption='Component - General' withShadow>\n              <img src={image_figma_4} alt='Component - General' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia caption='Component sticker sheet' withShadow>\n              <img src={image_figma_5} alt='Component sticker sheet' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia caption='Component gallery' withShadow>\n              <img src={image_figma_6} alt='Component gallery' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n          <p>\n            We've iterated this design library for a few times in the past,\n            starting with a Sketch library which required manual cloud sync-up,\n            to a beta Figma library with incomplete components after migrating\n            from Sketch, and lastly to the most recent revamped Figma library\n            with all the components rebuilt using the latest Figma features like\n            variants and auto layout v3. There are a few things I learnt\n            throughout this process that I think are the key to a successful\n            design library.\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Name conventions are important and should be defined early in the\n              stage.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Aligning Figma components with code can help bridge the\n              communication gap between design and engineering.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Breaking down the component library into meaningful categories\n              help both delivering and receiving small and manageable library\n              updates in an agile cadence.{' '}\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              It's good to separate the private component source files from the\n              public component gallery to support the different access and usage\n              for customers and creators.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              Always encourage the broader team to participate in the creation\n              process and evangelize that the ownership of a design system\n              belongs to the entire team.\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n          <Article.Quote author='Phillip Lee, Sr. Product Designer'>\n            Shoutout to the Feather team for walking some of us through the new\n            Feather Figma Library last week. Sooo thorough and organized - the\n            level of detail in this is insane. I’ve worked at a handful of large\n            tech companies and I’ll tell you what, having this resource is not\n            normal. First class type stuff 🌟\n          </Article.Quote>\n          <br />\n\n          <h5>Reusable Code</h5>\n          <p>\n            In Feather we created over <b>130 web components</b> for use in apps\n            built with <b>React</b> or plain <b>HTML/CSS</b>, from essential\n            building blocks like buttons to advanced React components like date\n            pickers, typeaheads, and charts. They all have Twitter’s visual\n            design language built in, and are designed with accessibility and\n            internationalization in mind. By using these Feather components,\n            engineers can avoid tons of repetitive work, focus on solving the\n            real problems and ultimately bring products to market quickly. Take\n            typography as an example, in the years we've been working on\n            Feather, Twitter's design team has changed its core typography at\n            least three times. And this affects every web app at Twitter.\n            Normally this takes weeks to roll out across every team. Through\n            Feather, we can update everyone's typography in a day.\n          </p>\n\n          <h5>Cross-discipline Docs</h5>\n          <p>\n            Docs are essential to how we help our customers and Feather provides\n            cross-discipline documentation through an internal website at\n            go/feather. In the Feather docs, we work closely with designers,\n            content strategists and engineers to create and share:\n          </p>\n          <ol>\n            <li>\n              design guidelines and best practices about using components\n              individually or together with each other in order to achieve a\n              good, consistent user experience\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              content strategy recommendations about how to craft content in a\n              component or a product, to effectively communicate with our users\n              in consistent tones and voice\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              thorough API documentation along with interactive examples for\n              quickly prototyping ideas right in the docs\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n          <Article.Slider type='macbook'>\n            <img src={image_docs_1} alt='Feather docs screenshot 1' />\n            <img src={image_docs_2} alt='Feather docs screenshot 2' />\n            <img src={image_docs_3} alt='Feather docs screenshot 3' />\n            <img src={image_docs_4} alt='Feather docs screenshot 4' />\n            <img src={image_docs_5} alt='Feather docs screenshot 5' />\n            <img src={image_docs_6} alt='Feather docs screenshot 6' />\n            <img src={image_docs_7} alt='Feather docs screenshot 7' />\n            <img src={image_docs_8} alt='Feather docs screenshot 8' />\n          </Article.Slider>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Creation Process</h4>\n          <p>\n            During my time at Twitter, I also helped define and formalize the\n            creation process for our design system. As Feather is widely used\n            across Twitter, any little change we make in the system can\n            introduce a lot of impact to our customers. Thus, it's very\n            important to have a clear and transparent process to guide ourselves\n            as well as for everyone else to see and understand how we plan and\n            implement the roadmap.\n          </p>\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup className={classnames.PROCESS_DIAGRAM}>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img src={image_creation_process} alt='Creation process' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n          <h5>1. Collect and Evaluate Ideas</h5>\n          <p>\n            Our creation process starts with ideating. The team receive a lot of\n            inquiries, requests and feedback from our customers everyday. And\n            all this input contributes to ideas about what should we work on\n            next. Before we line up any project in the Feather roadmap, we\n            evaluate those ideas by asking several questions:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Does this component solve a problem in a way that another\n              component could not?\n            </li>\n            <li>Will this component unblock large products?</li>\n            <li>Who will be the customers using this component?</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>\n            Feather already comes with a pretty robust component library, so\n            we’ll first evaluate if we can solve the problem by adopting or\n            extending existing components, before we create a new one. In\n            general, a component or pattern is more useful when there is a need\n            across multiple products, and we also tend to prioritize those ideas\n            so we can help more people.\n          </p>\n          <h5>2. Design Exploration</h5>\n          <p>\n            Once we decide on a project, a lead designer will dive deep and\n            explore the design solution. Usually this designer is a member from\n            the core team, but it can be any designer who wants to contribute,\n            paired with a design system shepherd from our team. And it is a very\n            collaborative process. Together, we define the scope of the\n            component by identifying use cases that this component will support\n            and rule out those that should be solved in other ways. We explore\n            all the details of a component early in the stage, like what\n            variants needed, how and when they should be used. These questions\n            guide us to create components in a more thoughtful way.\n          </p>\n          <h5>3. Build and Document</h5>\n          <p>\n            After we gain a clear understanding of what we want to add into\n            Feather, we’ll start building and documenting. We build components\n            in both our Figma library for designers and web components for\n            engineers, so that we have a synchronized design system to make\n            communication easier. We create design guidelines about using\n            components individually or together with each other. We work closely\n            with our content strategists to provide recommendations about how to\n            craft content in a component or a product, to effectively\n            communicate with our users in consistent tones and voice.\n          </p>\n          <h5>4. Experiment</h5>\n          <p>\n            Once we created the experimental component or changes along with the\n            draft docs, we want to test them before we actually make it stable\n            for everyone to use. We partner with designers and engineers to test\n            these new features in real life so that we can learn more about the\n            new design, the technical APIs, guidelines, or documentation,\n            starting with a smaller group.\n          </p>\n          <h5>5. Get Feedback</h5>\n          <p>\n            The feedback we collect from those experiments will either be fed\n            into the next round of polish or generate new ideas for future\n            projects.\n          </p>\n          <h5>Iteration Makes Perfect</h5>\n          <p>\n            I went through this entire creation process in these linear steps,\n            but really it is very agile and iterative in practice. Just like the\n            experiment and feedback loop, a few rounds of iterations could\n            totally happen within a single day, similarly for the rest of the\n            process. The Feather team has been working in this agile and\n            collaborative way together with our 110+ contributors, and we all\n            believe that iteration makes perfect.\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Beyond Feather</h4>\n          <p>\n            When I joined Twitter, Feather was an autonomous team under the\n            revenue design team, and similarly for other design system teams\n            like Horizon or Atmosphere. As much as we talk and work with each\n            other, and even sharing design assets like colors and icons, we\n            still feel like working in silos because we are organizationally\n            distributed in different corners. Thus, to unify and accelerate\n            product delivery across teams and disciplines, we formed a\n            centralized Design Systems team in 2020 and started to imagine the\n            future of design systems at Twitter as one team. Since then, I got\n            more opportunities to work with other design system colleagues to\n            overcome new challenges beyond Feather.\n          </p>\n          <h5>Unified Design Language</h5>\n          <p>\n            When Feather was started 7 years ago, it focused on business\n            products and internal tools, where it helped solve some of the more\n            complex design problems like presenting a large amount of data in\n            tables and charts. Since then, more Twitter design systems have\n            emerged to support specific needs for other audiences, like consumer\n            and marketing products. Collectively, one of our largest challenges\n            is to deliver a cohesive user experience across these systems and\n            present one Twitter brand in our products. So, we're working with\n            our design system friends, the brand and marketing team, and our\n            customers to define and build a unified Twitter visual design\n            language. By sharing this design language, we hope to align the\n            design and engineering practices across all our teams. We also aim\n            to create a strong foundation so we can continue building trust and\n            awareness of evolving Twitter's brand through all our products.\n          </p>\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={isMediumUp ? 3 : 2}>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img\n                src={image_vdl_1}\n                alt='Unified design language - brand refresh'\n              />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img\n                src={image_vdl_2}\n                alt='Unified design language - visual principles'\n              />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img\n                src={image_vdl_3}\n                alt='Unified design language - design techniques'\n              />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img\n                src={image_vdl_4}\n                alt='Unified design language - core styles'\n              />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img\n                src={image_vdl_5}\n                alt='Unified design language - mobile examples'\n              />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia>\n              <img\n                src={image_vdl_6}\n                alt='Unified design language - desktop examples'\n              />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n          <h5>System of Systems</h5>\n          <p>\n            Creating a unified design language is the primary approach we're\n            taking to unify all the experiences we serve to our customers in\n            different products and platforms. However, that is only the first\n            step to make all the systems work together and better, merely\n            focusing on the outcome. It doesn't really help us define a clear\n            view of the eco-system for all our design systems and answer all the\n            internal questions we heard, like when should I use which design\n            system. This is an inevitable problem the team needs to figure out\n            when we gather all the systems and try to make them work together\n            seamlessly.

In University of\n            Michigan we have a ton of cool content we want to share with our\n            audiences, so establishing an intelligent way to distribute\n            interesting content to certain target audience group becomes really\n            critical in the connection with them. And Victors Experience is one\n            solid step we took toward this goal.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This site mainly consists of three parts, a Javascript based\n            client-side Single-Page Application, a PHP based server-side app and\n            a custom Content Management System that it connects to. The\n            client-side browser experience allows a user to view and customize\n            their content based on their own preferences. The server app is\n            basically an orchestra layer that handles AJAX requests from the\n            client and return according contents from the CMS. Lastly, the CMS\n            is internally used to manage our contents and user data. For\n            example, some of our alumni are fairly high profile and we already\n            know what they're interested in, so we will create special accounts\n            for them using the CMS to input what types of content we anticipated\n            them liking.\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>My Role</h4>\n          <p>\n            <b>My Role:</b> Web Designer & Developer\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I joined the{' '}\n            <Article.Link\n              href='https://cm.engin.umich.edu/'\n              rel='noreferrer'\n              target='_blank'\n            >\n              Office of Communication and Marketing\n            </Article.Link>{' '}\n            as a part-time student-employee when I was in my second year\n            pursuing the master degree of Human Computer Interaction in\n            University of Michigan.

My\n            primary focus was the front end web app design and development while\n            I also helped in structuring the back end APIs and participated in\n            some design work. Overall, it was a great in-campus opportunity for\n            me to practise what I learned from the textbooks and apply that to\n            an industry product that solves real-life problem.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Design Tools:</b> Pencil & Paper, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe\n            Illustrator\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <b>Tech Stack:</b> HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX, PHP,\n            Facebook APIs, Git\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Outcome</h4>\n          <p>\n            Since this is an in-campus part-time job I did as a student, so the\n            outcome of the project is probably more about my personal growth as\n            a Front End Developer and a UX Designer in addition to my limited\n            contribution to the goal of the team to promote Michigan Engineering\n            and enhance its reputation. Through this six months' project, I\n            gained a better understanding about how a modern web app could be\n            structured end to end and how the data architecture looks like in\n            order for it to function seamlessly. I also learned a lot about what\n            kind of slick animation we can achieve purely using CSS and how big\n            impact that a little animation and that delightful moment can\n            actually make to the end user experience. And all these little\n            inspiration here and there provided me a totally different\n            perspective to reflect on and rethink about what I had seen and\n            heard from

But\n            before we dive into the technology world, let's first take a quick\n            glance at some of the research and design work the team put together\n            so that we can understand the story better. Since the first day it\n            was born, Watson Education have been a team that persistently learn,\n            practice and adopt the IBM Design Thinking framework to solve our\n            users’ problems at speed and scale. So first question to ask, who\n            are our users and what problems they are facing?\n          </p>\n          <h5>Meet Jamie</h5>\n          <p>\n            Jamie is a 7th grade math teacher at a medium-sized public school in\n            San Francisco. Jamie is married and has a 4-year old son. She loves\n            her students, but struggles to balance her dedication to teaching\n            with finding time for her family. She has a wide range of students\n            each year and works to ensure all their needs are met. She wishes\n            she knew more about her students going into the new year and had a\n            better way to keep track of their progress throughout the year. She\n            thrives on helping her students succeed. While we also have created\n            personas for elementary teacher as well as principal/superintendent,\n            so far we've been focusing on helping Jamie as the primary persona\n            that represents the main user group from our client schools and\n            districts.\n          </p>\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={1}>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_persona_jamie} alt='Teacher Persona - Jamie' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n          <h5>Jamie's Challenges</h5>\n          <p>\n            In high-level summary, Jamie, just like other teachers in the K-12\n            education industry, is under enormous pressure to assess her\n            students, ensure their mastery and meet state standards. However,\n            there’s very little time for her to develop plans that keep students\n            engaged, and personalize learning experiences based on a deeper\n            knowledge of students’ interests, strengths and weaknesses. The\n            causes of these challenges are a complex mix, including but not\n            limited to the disparate sources of student information, lack timely\n            awareness of student performance and difficulty to find related,\n            targeted and trusted learning contents.\n          </p>\n          <h5>Restless Reinvention</h5>\n          <p>\n            Watson Classroom is a product we designed for teachers, and more\n            importantly we designed it with teachers. With the help from all the\n            teachers participated in the sponsor user program, we not only gain\n            insights about themselves: their goals, daily tasks, challenges,\n            frustrations and desires, but also collect their feedback about our\n            ideas, explorations, prototypes and product releases in a regular\n            basis. The design team has been taking the problems and solutions as\n            an ongoing conversation with our users, and restlessly iterate the\n            design in a continuous cycle of observing, reflecting, and making.\n            Given the non-disclosure agreement, I can't elaborate the details\n            here about how our design solves Jamie's pain points and the\n            rationale behind it, but the essential is that we closely\n            collaborate with teachers and strive for a revolutionary education\n            experience to make teachers' lives easier and help them success.\n          </p>\n          <Article.Slider type='multiple'>\n            <img\n              src={image_design_process_1}\n              alt='Design Exercise - Stakeholder Mapping'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_design_process_2}\n              alt='Design Exercise - Questions & Assumptions'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_design_process_3}\n              alt='Design Exercise - Personas'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_design_process_4}\n              alt='Design Exercise - As-Is Scenarios'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_design_process_5}\n              alt='Design Exercise - Big Ideas'\n            />\n            <img src={image_design_process_6} alt='Design Exercise - Hills' />\n            <img\n              src={image_design_process_7}\n              alt='Design Exercise - Storyboarding'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_design_process_8}\n              alt='Design Exercise - Teacher Shadowing'\n            />\n          </Article.Slider>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Bring It To Life</h4>\n          <p>\n            Much as I'd like to deep dive into the tech stack behind the glass\n            of Watson Classroom and how we leverage Watson's cognitive\n            capabilities to solve teachers' problems, I can't disclosure much\n            details in this article. Even though, I think it still makes sense\n            for me to go through some of the contribution I made in the\n            production workflow improvement and team development in general.\n            Watson Education was like a unfledged startup organization within\n            the Big Blue IBM, and the front end team was also very young and\n            still inexperienced at the intersection of artificial intelligence,\n            cloud computing and human-centered design. Since the first day I\n            joined, I've been observing and learning the challenges and\n            inhibitors of the team and dedicating myself to the adoption of\n            modern technology and methods to optimize product performance and\n            scalability, improve code quality and dev workflow, foster a culture\n            of embracing agile development and continuous delivery.\n          </p>\n          <h5>Design Guideline & UI Toolkit</h5>\n          <p>\n            Benefiting from being geographical co-located with the design team\n            in the Austin studio, I was able to work closely with my designers\n            on defining the design guideline and lead the work to \"translate\"\n            the design language into a UI toolkit that the front end team can\n            leverage in daily development tasks. This UI toolkit is a\n            modularized components library implemented in AngularJS and SCSS. As\n            the design style guide grows and evolves in a living Sketch file,\n            the front end team also actively maintain this components library to\n            be aligned with the design doc in parallel with other release work.\n            All the time and effort we invested is totally worthwhile with the\n            return in lots of ways: significant reduction in design specs work\n            and communication cost, confidence of accessibility and consistency\n            of the experience we delivered across the product, ease of\n            implementation and maintenance with high quality reusable code.\n          </p>\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={2}>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_styleguide_1} alt='Design Guideline Essentials' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_styleguide_2} alt='Design Guideline Components' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n          <h5>Git Workflow & Branching Model</h5>\n          <p>\n            Back to the time I got onboard, the dev team just completed the big\n            migration from IBM RTC to Github Enterprise. While most of the\n            engineers felt comfortable using basic git features to commit and\n            push codes, there was neither standardized git workflow nor clear\n            branching model for a long time to guide the team organize their\n            codebase and manage releases. In the meantime, the leadership team\n            was visioning a transition to a continuous delivery release\n            strategy, but I knew it's hardly feasible without improving the\n            development process. With that in my mind, I spent around three\n            months doing research, putting together a proposal for Git workflow\n            and branching model, getting buy-ins from the leadership and\n            management team, and finally educating the broader dev team to get\n            everyone onboard.\n          </p>\n          <Article.MultimediaGroup column={2}>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_git_1} alt='Git Workflow Goals' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_git_2} alt='Git Workflow As-Is Scenario' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_git_3} alt='Feature Branch Model' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n            <Article.Multimedia withBorder>\n              <img src={image_git_4} alt='Release Branch Model' />\n            </Article.Multimedia>\n          </Article.MultimediaGroup>\n          <p>\n            The outcome of this activity is highly recognized and well\n            appreciated by the entire production team.

On a more detailed\n            level, Chengqi not only came up with the proposal, he provided\n            detailed Git instructions for the development team on how to\n            implement feature branching to get buy-ins from developers, and also\n            a nicely designed presentation deck to get buy-ins from development\n            leaders. Overall, it was a tremendous contribution to the team.\n          </Article.Quote>\n          <br />\n          <h5>Task Automation With Gulp</h5>\n          <p>\n            Modern web app development has front loaded a lot of\n            responsibilities from the server end to the client end. Watson\n            Classroom Enlight is no exception, in addition to creating and\n            rendering the interfaces, our front end application needs to take\n            care of many more things like Ajax data loading, data manipulating,\n            page routing and so on so forth. While the app continuously grows,\n            we find out the team doing tons of repetitive tasks to work with and\n            maintain the more and more bulky codebase. Thus, I introduced Gulp\n            to the team to automate those painful and time-consuming tasks and\n            streamline front end development workflow. Here is a rough list of\n            the tasks I built up with Gulp and its ecosystem:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Sass to CSS compilation</li>\n            <li>Automated CSS vendor prefixes processing</li>\n            <li>Embedding HTML templates into AngularJS</li>\n            <li>Bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets</li>\n            <li>Automated SVG icon cleanup and sprite generation</li>\n            <li>Automated browser refresh and sync</li>\n            <li>Automated unit tests</li>\n            <li>One step app build process for deployment</li>\n          </ul>\n          <h5>Squads & Scrums</h5>\n          <p>\n            Applying agile development practices is especially challenging in a\n            team that is distributed across multiple time zones and regions of\n            the world. Our global leadership and management team has never\n            stopped learning, exploring, pushing and reflecting to seek for the\n            most proper and practical agile methods and practices that work for\n            this team. As part of that, I work effectively with them to propose,\n            implement and standardize the squads and scrums approach with the\n            goal of facilitating collaboration and achieving alignments across\n            function units and production teams. During each release and sprint,\n            I actively participate in leading squads to do daily virtual\n            stand-ups through Slack, weekly scrums through online meetings and\n            sprint showcase and retrospection with the broad production team.\n            Through all the ups and downs, we together foster a team culture\n            with a passion to be more agile, more productive, and more\n            responsive to the market, customers and partners.\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n\n        <Article.Section>\n          <h4>Outcome & Impact</h4>\n          <p>\n            Education is an exciting and relatable industry that needs a\n            considerable amount of help and our incredible users are what\n            excites us and keeps us moving forward every day. As we learn more\n            about teachers and administrators, it's clear to see just how much\n            of an impact we could make in their lives as well as the students\n            they influence by giving them a software that meets their needs. By\n            the time I'm writing this article, Watson Education team has\n            delivered four major releases and countless granular updates,\n            refinements and fix-packs of Watson Classroom to a growing number of\n            districts and schools.\n          </p>\n          <ul className={classnames.RELEASE_LIST}>\n            <li>\n              <b>Aristotle</b>: foundation release from the ground up.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <b>Benjamin</b>: extension, refinement and scalability.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <b>Copernicus</b>: visual refresh and rebrand.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <b>Darwin</b>: student mastery model enhancement.\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <b>Einstein</b>: upcoming release for performance and\n              customization.\n            </li>\n            <li>... more to come.</li>\n          </ul>\n          <p>\n            We name each of our release after a great educator in the history as\n            a reminder to stay focused with our target users and be inspired by\n            their spirit of devotion. Each milestone we achieved together is a\n            step toward the better tomorrow for every educator and learner. We\n            have always pursued world-changing progress. We believe that the\n            application of cognitive capabilities in education can truly\n            transform the learning experience by delivering personalized\n            education throughout the entire lifelong learning journey.\n          </p>\n          <Article.Slider type='macbook'>\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_1}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_2}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_3}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_4}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_5}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_6}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_7}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_8}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_9}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n            <img\n              src={image_iwc_product_10}\n              alt='IBM Watson Classroom Enlight App'\n            />\n          </Article.Slider>\n          <br />\n          <Article.Quote author='Samira Khan, Richard J.

The learner is more than a number or a\n            grade. I can add information about the child’s interests and\n            learning style, or add other notes that will not only help me, but\n            their future educators.\n          </Article.Quote>\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <p className='centered'>\n            <Button\n              href='https://www.ibm.com/watson/education'\n              icon={icons.compass}\n              rel='noreferrer'\n              size='large'\n              target='_blank'\n              type='link'\n            >\n              Learn more\n            </Button>\n          </p>\n        </Article.Section>\n      </Project.Body>\n    </Project>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default WatsonClassroom;\n","import './ProjectsPage.scss';\nimport * as React from 'react';\nimport classNames from 'classnames';\nimport icons from 'lib/icons';\nimport PageSection from 'components/PageSection';\nimport {\n  StoredIQ,\n  RetinaWallpaper,\n  SweetMoments,\n  FeatherDesignSystem,\n  WatsonClassroom,\n} from './projects';\n\nconst classnames = {\n  BASE: 'ProjectsPage',\n};\n\nfunction ProjectsPage() {\n  return (\n    <PageSection className={classNames(classnames.BASE)} id='projects'>\n      <PageSection.Header icon={icons.projects}>\n        With my hybrid background in design and engineering along with a heart\n        filled with curiosity, I've been exploring all the fun and challenging\n        parts of creating a product from different perspectives.
